# How I Landed a Dream Remote Internship!

**Harshil Tomar**
3 min read · May 22, 2024

After multiple internships and a range of experiences in software development, I was excited to share my recent journey through a rigorous recruitment process for a Remote Internship. Here's how it all unfolded.

## A Bit About Me

### Experience
- SDE Intern, NewGen Software
- Fullstack Developer @Infiniti Solutions
- Frontend Engineer @Spotline, USA (Remote)
- UI/UX Designer, Fiverr

### Tech Stack
- **Languages:** C++, JavaScript, Java
- **Backend Development:** Express.js, Node.js, Backend TypeScript
- **Frontend Development:** HTML, CSS, React.js, TypeScript, Next.js, Tailwind
- **Database:** Firebase, MySQL, MongoDB, Prisma, Postgres
- **Version Control:** Git, GitHub, Docker

## Source of Opportunity

I found this opportunity through a Twitter DM from a member who reached out directly.

## Interview Process

### Screening Round

The first round was a brief 30–40 minute screening where we discussed the role and relevant tech stacks. This role was for a full-stack SWE Internship, focusing on Next.js, TypeScript, and Postgres with AWS. I introduced myself, detailing my previous experiences and internships, particularly highlighting my work with Next.js projects.

### Coding Round 1

The next step was a fast-paced live coding round. I was tasked with building a mailing system with two input boxes on the frontend: one for the mail content and another for entering multiple email addresses. The system needed to display the list of emails, allow deletion of emails, and integrate a mailing extension. I chose Node-mailer and Mailtrap to send dummy emails. Despite the pressure, I successfully implemented these features.

### Coding Round 2/System Design

This round combined system design and coding and lasted close to two hours. I was asked to design a tipping system for a restaurant using Excalidraw. This involved planning screens, image storage using upload services or AWS, and ensuring fast loading times. Following the system design, I rapidly coded the initial frontend screen of this system.

Additionally, I showcased the mailing system from the previous round, which now included a Prisma DB integration for adding and deleting users and an unsubscribe button in the emails. This demonstration served as a strong proof of work.

### Cultural Fit

The final round was an HR and team cultural fit interview, focusing on my thought processes and how well I would fit into the team.

## Outcome

A week later, I received an email informing me that I had been selected for the internship! This entire experience has been incredibly rewarding, and I'm thrilled to start this new journey with HiFive.

## Reflections and Advice

Looking back, the combination of technical prowess, preparation, and a strong demonstration of previous work played a crucial role in my success. For anyone preparing for similar opportunities, I recommend the following:

- **Technical Skills:** Keep honing your technical skills, particularly those relevant to the role.
- **Preparation:** Practice coding and system design problems regularly.
- **Presentation:** Be ready to showcase your previous work and explain your thought processes clearly.
- **Cultural Fit:** Understand the company's culture and demonstrate how you align with it during the interview.

Placement seasons can be stressful, but persistence and continuous improvement are key. Sometimes, opportunities come when you least expect them, and every experience adds value to your journey. Keep moving forward, and success will follow.
